What This Project Does
I built a simple library system where you can:

Add books to the library

Register people as library users

Track when books are returned

Search for books by title or author

See what books each person has borrowed

It's like a mini version of what libraries use to keep track of their books and who has them.

The Files You'll Find
I created 6 Java files:

Book.java - This handles everything about a single book (title, author, whether someone borrowed it, etc.)

User.java - This keeps track of library users and what books they have (users can only borrow 3 books max)

Library.java - This is the FIle where the info of the library is created.

LibrarySystem.java - This is file has the main method to run and access the application.
