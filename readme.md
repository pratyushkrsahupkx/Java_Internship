This project is a simple Java console calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—continuously from the command line until they choose to exit.

Key Features:

Implements separate methods for each arithmetic operation, promoting code organization and reuse.

Uses Java's Scanner class to accept user input for both numbers and selected operations.

Includes a looping menu system to let users perform as many calculations as needed.

Handles division by zero and invalid inputs , displaying clear error messages.
