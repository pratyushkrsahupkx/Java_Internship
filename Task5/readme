This project is a simple command-line application that lets users simulate basic bank operations. The program allows you to add users, deposit and withdraw money, check account balances, and review transaction history.

What this program does: 

Create user bank accounts with a account number and name.

Deposit money into user accounts, with input validation.

Withdraw money, enforcing balance checks before transactions.

Check current balance for any user account.

View transaction history (all deposits and withdrawals) for each account.

All user interaction is from a simple, easy-to-navigate text-based menu.
